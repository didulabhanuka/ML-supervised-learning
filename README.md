# Predicting Income Class using Supervised Learning Models

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether an individual's income exceeds \$50,000 per year based on census data. It's a binary classification problem widely used for evaluating machine learning algorithms.

We apply various supervised learning models to build a predictive system using demographic and employment-related features. These models include:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

The goal is to explore and compare model performances in terms of accuracy and interpretability, while learning how different features influence income classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Adult Income Dataset**, sourced from a [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aditimulye/adult-income-dataset-from-scratch?select=adult.csv) created by Aditi Mulye. It contains approximately 32,000 records and includes 15 attributes, both numerical and categorical.

**Features include:**

- `age`: Age of the individual
- `workclass`: Type of employment (e.g., Private, Self-emp)
- `education`: Highest level of education (e.g., Bachelors, HS-grad)
- `education-num`: Numeric representation of education level
- `occupation`: Type of job (e.g., Exec-managerial, Sales)
- `hours-per-week`: Hours worked per week
- `native-country`: Country of origin
- `income`: Target variable (`<=50K` or `>50K`)
