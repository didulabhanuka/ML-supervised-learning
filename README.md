Predicting Income Class using Supervised Learning Models

Overview

The income of an individual is influenced by several factors, such as education level, occupation, age, and work class, among others. Income prediction is a popular problem in machine learning and classification.
There are several features that can affect the income level of an individual, including:
•	Age: The age of the individual.
•	Work class: Type of employment (e.g., Private, Self-emp).
•	Education: Highest level of education attained (e.g., Bachelors, HS-grad).
•	Occupation: Type of job (e.g., Exec-managerial, Sales).
•	Hours per week: The number of hours worked per week.
•	Income: Target variable, representing income greater than 50K or less than or equal to 50K.

To accurately predict income levels, we compile a dataset containing these features, which is then used to train machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. 
These models help identify relationships between the features and income, ultimately assisting in predicting whether an individual earns more or less than 50K annually.

Dataset
The models used in this project (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) are supervised machine learning algorithms, which require a labeled dataset for training. 
The dataset used for this project is the Adult Income Dataset, which contains approximately 32,560 records with 15 features. These features include both categorical and numerical data that describe various aspects of an individual's background and employment status.
